# Jamming
This is my implementation of the Code Academy Project: Jamming.

## Hosted
The project is currently hosted on http://jamming-curator.surge.sh/
(might be down later)

### Extra Feature
As my added feature I chose to add a preview audio player that delivers a 30 second preview of the selected song. If the track doesn't have a preview_url property it displays in the title. (most older songs on Spotify seem to not have this)
